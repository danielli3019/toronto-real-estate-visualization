Overheating
We continued to detect moderate
evidence of overheating in 2019Q3
due to imbalances witnessed in recent
years. Specifically, the Sales to New
Listings Ratio (SNLR) for Toronto
stood above the threshold at least
twice over the past 12 quarters
preceding 2019Q3 (in 2016Q4 and
2017Q1). Strong growth in seasonally
adjusted sales compared to the
previous quarter, coupled with
declining new listings resulted in the
SNLR reaching nearly 60% in 2019Q3.
Housing market activity continued
to increase across all housing types,
with the multi-family sector having
tighter market conditions (e.g. the
SNLR for condominium apartments in
2019Q3 was 67%, near the threshold
set for overheating, compared to 60%
during the same time a year prior).
Housing markets across the Greater
Toronto Area (GTA) continued
to recover in 2019Q3. The City of
Toronto, Halton and Peel Regions
had SNLRs around 60% compared
to Durham and York Regions, which
had SNRLs around the 50% mark.
Housing market activity continued
its upward momentum in 2019Q4
with the seasonally adjusted SNLR
reaching 66% for all housing types.
Strong sales coupled with some
pullback in the new listings supply
helped to push the ratio into sellers’
market territory and towards
the threshold (70%) set to signal
market overheating.
Price Acceleration
We continued to detect moderate
evidence of price acceleration in
2019Q3 (see Figure 2). This is because
the test statistic for this factor stood
above its critical threshold at least
once over the 12 quarters preceding
2019Q3 (in 2016 Q4, 2017Q1, and
2017Q2). In order for us to discount
any evidence of price acceleration,
the GTA would have to experience
moderate price growth for a longer
period4
. The seasonally adjusted
average MLS® price grew by 3.8% in
2019Q3, compared to the previous
quarter. Prices grew for all housing
types across all regions of the GTA.
Price growth for condominium
apartments was the strongest, in line
with tighter market conditions for
that housing type. 
In 2019Q4, the average seasonally
adjusted MLS® price continued to
grow, albeit at a slightly lower pace
of 2.6% from the previous quarter.
Price growth was strongest for
multi-unit homes; although singledetached home prices showed
signs of recovery (see Figure 3).
Overvaluation
We continued to detect low
evidence of overvaluation in 2019Q3.
However, the average overvaluation
gap (between actual house prices
and price levels predicted by housing
market fundamentals) had been
trending upwards since Q4 2018.
Overvaluation was easing for nearly
a year until 2018Q3. The real MLS®
average house price increased by
1.16% in 2019Q3 from the same time
a year earlier, while growth in real
disposable income edged up by
0.33% and the young adult population
(25-34 years) increased by 3.81%.
Overbuilding
A low degree of vulnerability in
overbuilding is maintained for 2019Q3.
While the inventory of completed and
unsold units per 10,000 population
edged up to 1.61 from the previous
quarter, it remains well below the
overbuilding threshold of 4.10.
Demand for condominium apartments
from homebuyers as well as investors
(encouraged to rent in a tight rental
market) remained strong and as a
result, fewer units remained unsold
upon completion.
